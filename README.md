# Movies

Project to display movies from an API.

- Goal is to build this using React and Routes to take the user to the movie detials page for the selected movie.
- Started by setting up the base for the project and making sure I was able to accurately pull the movie details and redirect to the correct movie details upon clicking of a title.
- If Ih ad more time I would have added more animations on actions and implemented an error page for if a user were to enter a URL that does not exist.
- To run locally, npm i && code . && npm run dev
